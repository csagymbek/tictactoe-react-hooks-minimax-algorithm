#### Setting up 
`npm i styled-components papercss react-modal`

For setting up the game we'll use Styled components, a CSS framework papercss, which will give the game cool minimalistic styling (my website uses papercss as well), and React-modal to display the game results. We'll start by creating empty project and installing necessary dependencies. 
After the project is setup, we can begin by modifying App.js to include the main game components and papercss styles.

`import styled from "styled-components";`

`import "papercss/dist/paper.min.css";`
